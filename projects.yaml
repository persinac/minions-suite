# Project registry — each entry defines a project to review.
#
# review_profile composes a prompt from:
#   roles:     domain expertise (backend, frontend, data_engineer, devops, security)
#   languages: language-specific rules (python, typescript, go, sql, shell)
#   custom:    org/team-specific rules loaded from prompts/custom/
#
# model can be overridden per-project (falls back to global default in env).

defaults:
  model: gpt-4o
